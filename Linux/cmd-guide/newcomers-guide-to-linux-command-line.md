# Newcomers guide to Linux command line

One day, you enrolled at an university, to study as an IT student, maybe you landed an IT job out of nowhere, or perhaps you want to use Raspberry Pi to set up your home weather station. And here comes a shock. It's required from you, to use Linux, in all three cases. Even if it's not required right away, eventually, you will get there. Suddenly, you have to use Linux operating system. All these years you have probably lived your life alongside with Microsoft Windows on your computer. You were proud of all the tricks and tips you learned about Windows. Now, you are at square one again, you know close to nothing.

You are probably told to type something into some sort of terminal and when you do, some incomprehensible mess pops up on your screen, and you don't know what to make of it. Well then, let us start slowly.

# What is a terminal?
This term has a history, but as a term, it has been alive ever since the first computers were born. Computers which back then, at universities and research labs, used up most of the space of a room. Those big computers were controlled via terminals, which were comprised of a keyboard, screen and cables connecting it to the computer. Terminal used to be an entry point for a user, who wanted to control the computer. Nowadays these terminals are purely as a software inside your machine, but purpose of a terminal remains the same. It enables you to control your machine by typing commands, switches and arguments.

# What are commands, switches and arguments?
In simple terms, it can be explained with these examples:
> Example No.1
>
> command = kick, argument = bucket
>
> Example No.2
>
> command = run, argument = slowly
>
> Example No.3
>
> command = dress up, switch = 

As you can see, by command you can order the computer what activity to do and by argument you can specify on which object you want to apply this activity or how you want to apply this activity.
